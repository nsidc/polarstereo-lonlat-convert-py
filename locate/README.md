```


## Usage

To use `locate.for`, simply run the compiled `locatefor` and follow the prompts.

For example, to use the `locatefor` docker image to convert northern hemisphere
I,J coordinates to latitude,longitude coordinates:

```
$ docker run -it locatefor
 Enter the grid cell dimension:
  1. 12.5 Km
  2. 25.0 Km
1
 Enter the hemisphere of interest:
  1. North
  2. South
1
 Enter one of the following transform functions:
  1. Convert I,J to Latitude, Longitude
  2. Convert Latitude, Longitude to I,J
1
 Enter the column number
 the valid range is (1-608)
200
 Enter the row number
 the valid range is (1-896)
300
