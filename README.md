## Usage

### locate

The `locate` directory includes fortran code for converting between I,J
coodinates of an SSM/I-SSMIS polar stereographic grid cell to latitude and longitude coordinates.

### lonlat-conversion-python

The `lonlat-conversion-python-scripts` directory contains python modules that
define functions that convert between longitude, latitude and Polar
Stereographic x, y (km) coordinates. Functions are also defined that transform
between longitude and latitude and NSIDC Polar Stereographic I, J (grid)
coordinates.
